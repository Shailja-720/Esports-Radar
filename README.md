Scour GRID history for strategies, comps, and killable weaknesses
Inspiration
The project drew inspiration from real-world esports analytics needs, particularly how professional League of Legends and VALORANT teams like Cloud9 use data to gain competitive edges before matches. GRID's official data platform, which provides live and historical telemetry from Riot Games, highlighted the potential for automated insights—transforming raw match data into actionable scouting reports. This mirrors tools like Oracle's Elixir or in-house analyst consoles, but automates the process for coaches, saving hours of manual review.
What I Learned
Building the application deepened understanding of esports data pipelines, from sourcing granular events (jungle paths, site setups) to pattern detection via statistical analysis. Key lessons included handling noisy telemetry data with techniques like win-rate clustering and Markov chains for strategy prediction, where P("win"|"comp")=(∑▒  "wins" )/(∑▒  "matches" ) quantifies composition strength. Challenges in real-time processing revealed the value of vector databases for champion/agent embeddings, enabling fast similarity searches for counters.
How I Built It
The core application uses Python with Pandas for data ingestion from GRID's League of Legends Data Portal and VALORANT feeds, scraping recent matches via APIs when direct access is limited. A FastAPI backend processes inputs like "Generate scouting report for Gen.G last 10 matches," running SQL-like queries on match states to extract metrics: macro strategies via heatmaps of objective contests, player tendencies through KDA variance σ_"KDA" =√((∑▒ (KDA_i-(KDA) ‾)^2)/n), and comp frequency with top-k clustering.
Visualization employs Plotly for interactive reports, deployed on Streamlit for demo ease. "How to Win" insights use counterfactual simulation: if opponent midlaner wins 15% vs. assassins, recommend picks like Zed by backtesting win-rate uplifts. Mock data from Kaggle's LoL datasets validated logic before GRID integration.
Challenges Faced
Accessing proprietary GRID data posed the biggest hurdle, as it's restricted to pros—solved via mock datasets and public APIs like Riot's, but limited historical depth. Differentiating noise from signal in player habits required anomaly detection, where false positives skewed tendencies (e.g., one-off pistol rushes). Scaling for VALORANT's site-specific setups needed game-mode pivots, and ensuring report digestibility meant iterating UI from dense tables to concise Markdown with embedded charts. Balancing creativity with accuracy ensured insights were data-backed, not speculative.
